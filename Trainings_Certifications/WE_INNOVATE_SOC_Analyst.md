# SOC Analyst Advanced Training ‚Äì Full Track  

This repository documents my training journey in the **Advanced SOC Analyst Track**,  
focusing on **enterprise-grade SOC operations, detection engineering, and incident response**.  
The program combines **hands-on labs, real-world attack simulations, and exposure to SIEM/SOAR ecosystems**  
to build deep expertise in **monitoring, hunting, and defending against modern cyber threats**.
