# WE INNOVATE Cybersecurity Bootcamp ‚Äì SOC Track  

This repository documents my training journey in the **SOC Track** of the **WE INNOVATE Cybersecurity Bootcamp**,  
organized by **WE Telecom Egypt, EG|CERT, NTRA, ITI, and ZeroSploit** at **Cairo University**.  
The program delivers **advanced, hands-on training** in **SOC operations, threat detection, and incident response**,  
using enterprise-grade SIEM and SOAR platforms, real-world attack simulations, and advanced defense techniques.
