# AWS Cloud Architecture 3 ‚Äì Capstone Project

## üìå Overview
This project was developed as part of my AWS Cloud Architecture training.  
It focuses on migrating and redesigning a legacy research web application into a **secure, scalable, and highly available AWS architecture** that follows cloud best practices.

---

## üìù Scenario
A nonprofit organization provides a website for social science researchers to access global development statistics (e.g., life expectancy by country).  

Originally:
- The app was hosted on a commercial hosting provider with limited security and support.  
- The website and MySQL database ran on the **same EC2 instance in a public subnet**.  
- Increasing traffic caused performance issues.  
- An attempted ransomware attack raised concerns about security.  

**Objective:** Redesign and migrate the application to AWS to improve **security, performance, and availability**.

---

## üí° Solution Summary
The new AWS architecture ensures:  
- Secure hosting of the **MySQL database** with controlled access.  
- Anonymous access for web users via an **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**.  
- Website hosted on **EC2 instances in private subnets** (t2.micro).  
- Secure **SSH access for administrators** only.  
- **Auto Scaling Group** for elasticity and high availability.  
- Data stored in **Amazon RDS (MySQL)** with Secrets Manager integration.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Steps

### 1. Amazon RDS (MySQL)
- Created RDS instance with `countries` database.  
- Credentials securely stored in **AWS Secrets Manager**.  
- Storage autoscaling enabled (20 GB).  
- Connected via private VPC security group.

### 2. Application Load Balancer (ALB)
- Internet-facing ALB named `AppELB`.  
- Target Group `ELB-TG` created to route traffic.  
- Deployed across **two Availability Zones** for redundancy.  
- Secured with **ALB Security Group**.

### 3. Auto Scaling Group (ASG)
- Launch Template (`Project-LT`) for EC2 instances.  
- EC2 instances deployed into **private subnets**.  
- Integrated with ALB target group.  
- Scaling policy:  
  - Min = 1 instance  
  - Max = 2 instances  

### 4. Database Configuration
- Connected to RDS using admin credentials from Secrets Manager.  
- Imported dataset (`Countrydatadump.sql`) into `countries` database.  
- Verified data availability via MySQL queries.

### 5. Testing
- Accessed the web app via **ALB DNS URL**.  
- Successfully queried development statistics by category.  
- Verified **load balancing and auto scaling** functionality.
